Numbers based on the mappedMemory benchmark.

For the rw (read + write) graph:
	After reading the flag, the GPU reads NUM_PKTS integers from mapped memory, 
	does some computation, and writes results back to mapped memory.

	The time taken for this exchange is measured.

For the w (write only) graph:
	After reading the flag, the GPU does some computation, and writes results 
	back to mapped memory. It does not read the packets from mapped memory.

	The time taken for this exchange is measured.
