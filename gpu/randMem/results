* Kernel execution time (excluding copy to and from) to measure random
memory access performance

Test params:
	NUM_PKTS = 8 * 1024 * 1024
	DEPTH = 8
	Random accesses per second = 1,333 M

Susitna: .024 s => 1,333 M random accesses per second
xia-router2: .042 s => 761.92 M random accesses per second


* Memory controllers:
	xia-router2: GTX 570 Ti: 2 64-bit memory controllers
	susitna: Tesla K20C: 6 64-bit memory controllers
