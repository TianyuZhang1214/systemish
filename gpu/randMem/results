Kernel execution time (excluding copy to and from) to measure random
memory access performance

Test params:
	NUM_PKTS = 8 * 1024 * 1024
	DEPTH = 8
	Random accesses per second = 1,333 M

Susitna: .024 s => 1,333 M random accesses per second
xia-router2: .042 s => 761.92 M random accesses per second
