/*
 * Two threads which increment a counter.
 * Observations:
 * 1. If both run in parallel without locks, the final answer is much less
 * than 2*MAX. It's more like 1.1*MAX. This is kind of expected because of the
 * time gap between a memory load and the corresponding writes to a register.
 *
 * 2. With fine grained locking: if both are run parallely with, the time required
 * is much more than that when run sequentially. This is due to bus banging.
