Mimics pointer chasing by doing dependent accesses. 

The simplest way to do this is addr = A[addr], but that leads
to a cycle as soon as addr takes a value that has already been
taken before. 

The expected number of memory dereferences before
that happens is given by the birthday paradox in is proportional
to the square root of CAP.
