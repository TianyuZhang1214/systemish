This is a demonstration program for masking DRAM latency with 
RAM prefetching.

We allocate a large array A and a smaller array of random indices
into that array. Later, we wish to do some processing with each element
of A indexed by the indices array.

Before we process an element of A, we issue a prefetch for the next
element of A that will get processed.
