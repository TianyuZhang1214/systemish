A simple shared memory client-server setup. The server creates a shared memory region and
starts writing to it. The server "lights the beacon" after it has written to the value.
The client reads the beacon to check if the corresponding value is valid.

Assumptions:
1. Memory operations are atomic.
2. Memory operations are oredered.
